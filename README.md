# Register Allocation Program for a Simple Compiler

## Developing and Contributing
### Pull Requests
- For any new feature/change, we create a new branch:
- We name the branch in the following format:
  - **category/name**
  - for example:
    - feat/graph-implementation
    - fix/linked-list-null-pointer
    - chore/scripts-function-documentation
```sh
# Take graph-implementation as an example
git checkout -b feat/graph-implementation
```

- Now, make any changes regarding this feature/area, only to its related branch
```sh
git add .
git commit -m "some commit message"
git push
```
- Once your changes are tested and finalized, go into the repository on github and into your branch
  - Here, you find a "contribute" button which will let you create a new pull request
- The pull request title should be in the format:
  - general-category(specific-category): description
  - in our example case, we can use something like the following:
    - feat(data-structure): graph implementation 
- Now, another member or yourself can approve or deny the pull request, as well as make any comments through the pull request menu.
- We can also delete the branch to keep things clean.
